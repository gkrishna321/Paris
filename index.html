          <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
             I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things while we were there!
          <h4 id="day1">Day 1<h4>
            On our first day, we started by visiting <b>Montmartre</b> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower (check out that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <b>la Seine</b>.<br>

          <h4 id="day2">Day 2<h4>
On our second day, we went shopping on <b>Avenue des Champs Elysees</b>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.
<br><br>
After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <b>Notre Dame</b>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished shopping, we visited <b>le Louvre</b>.<br>

          <h4 id="day3">Day 3<h4>
            The picture below is of me visiting the <b>Arc de Triomphe</b>. It's huge! We also went to le <b>Musee D'Orsay</b>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.<br>
